Network Packet Analyzer

WHAT IS A PACKET ANALYSER?
A packet sniffer is a piece of hardware or software used to monitor network traffic.In other words, a network sniffer “sniffs” network traffic for information - where it's coming from, which device, the protocol used. Network administrators use this information to help optimize their environment. 

HOW DO THEY WORK?
Sniffers work by examining streams of data packets that flow between computers on a network as well as between networked computers and the larger Internet.

BENEFITS OF USING A PACKET SNIFFER
In the right hands, a packet sniffer is useful for:-
1. Network packet sniffing can help enhance your security
2. Performing network penetration testing by monitoring the data and ensuring it is encrypted.
3. Tracking down network traffic bottlenecks
4. Testing firewalls for network security efficacy
5. Acquiring statistical data on network bandwidth, availability, etc.

In the wrong hands, a packet sniffer:
1. can allow anyone with little to no hacking skills to monitor network traffic over unsecured WiFi networks in order to steal passwords and other private information.
2. can be used in TCP Session Hijacking
3. can be used in DNS Poisoning
4. can be used in JavaScript Card Sniffing Attacks
5. can be used in Address resolution protocol (ARP) Sniffing
6. can be used in DHCP Attack.
